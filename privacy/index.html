            <b>Contact purposes</b> <br />
            When you make a purchase from us, procure any services from us, or
            make a donation to us, you are entering into a contract with us. In
            order to perform this contract we need to process and store your
            data. For example, we may need to contact you by email or telephone
            in the event of a cancellation of an event, or in the case of
            problems with your payment.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Legitimate organisational interests</b> <br />
            In certain situations we collect and process your personal data for
            purposes that are deemed legitimate organisational interests.
            However we only do this if there is no overriding prejudice to you
            by using your personal information in this way.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>With your explicit consent</b> <br />
            For any situations where the two bases above are not appropriate, we
            will instead ask for your explicit consent before using your
            personal information in that specific situation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Legal obligation</b> <br />
            On occasion it may be necessary for us to process data in order to

            order.

          We aim to communicate with you about the work that we do in ways that
          you find relevant, timely and respectful. To do this we use data that
          we have stored about you, such as what events you have booked for in
          the past, as well as any preferences you may have told us about.
        </p>
        <p>
          We use our legitimate organisational interest as the legal basis for
          communications by email or phone. We will provide you with an option
          to unsubscribe in every email that we subsequently send you.

          This website may use social sharing buttons which help share web

          question. Users are advised before using such social sharing buttons

        <p class="popup__subtitle">Shortened Links in Social Media</p>
        <p>
          This website and its owners through their social media platform
          accounts may share web links to relevant web pages. By default some
          social media platforms shorten lengthy urls.

          Users are advised to take caution and good judgement before clicking
          any shortened urls published on social media platforms by this website
          and its owners. Despite the best efforts to ensure only genuine urls
          are published many social media platforms are prone to spam and
          hacking and therefore this website and its owners cannot be held
          liable for any damages or implications caused by visiting any
          shortened links.
